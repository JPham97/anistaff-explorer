# Anime-Staff-Explorer

This program is used to explore connections between an anime of the user's choice and the animes they have in an online list. Using this program gives users another way to determine the next show they want to watch, especially if they typically enjoy multiple works from particular staff members and voice actors.

Ideally, the user has an account on [AniList](https://anilist.co/) and records the shows that they watch on the website.

A user should select a show they want to know more about and make a query within the program (queryAnime). The program will output all staff members that are present in both queryAnime and all staff members in the user's AniList (along with all anime that each staff member has worked on).
