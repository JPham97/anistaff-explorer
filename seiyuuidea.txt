seiyuu idea 9/12/20

IN FUTURE maybe extend to anime studios, directors, composers, OP artists, etc

MAL API - not public yet, requires auth and other things?
Jikan - scrapes MAL
anilist API

avac.moe
	pick anime1, pick anime2, outputs VAs in both
seiyuu.moe
	can compare a list of VAs and their respective shows
	seems more robust and modern
	has seasonal lists/seasonal overview
		click on a season
			-> output a list of VAs sorted by # of roles they have that season
	uses Jikan API

both these sites can compare VAs across 2 (2+ for seiyuu.moe) anime


GOAL:
implement the functionality of seiyuu.moe
in addition, add functionality for an inputted anime list
recommend new shows by finding new shows with favorite VAs (could be based on Planning)
overview of voice actors based on watched shows (top VAs based on Watched)

input a list through MAL API or AniList API (username)
or input a list through text (CSV of anime titles)
	need to search for each anime individually to map text names to actual things in db


// functionality
// (input = watched list/MAL or anilist username)
// (input2 = user requested show that they want to know more about VAs)
// (output = list of shows that share VAs with their req and shared VAs)
read in a user anime list
create a database of mappings // can do during search or preprocess
mapVA = animeTitle -> listVA

user inputs thisAnime name
get all available VA in thisAnime
newList outputAnimesMap
for each VA in thisAnimeVAList // based on user's requested anime
	for each currTitle in mapVA // this is based on the user's anime list
		if currTitle -> listVA contains VA // a VA associated with user's req
			// map the found title to the VA being searched for
			// if currTitle already has a VA list, add this VA
			create newMapping = currTitle -> list.add(VA)
			outputAnimesMap.add(newMapping)


outputAnimesMap will contain:
	a mapping of title -> VAlist
		title = a show that shares VAs with the user's requested show
		VAlist = list of VAs that appear in title and the user's requested show
could also contain VAs that ARE NOT shared




PLAN:
1. try to implement this algorithm using a small database that is manually generated
2. figure out how to use API to access MAL database

cases:
-show with no VA
-all common VA
-no common VA
-1 common VA
-some common VA


generate a random "Watched List" with same format as database
take in an input from database

VAs can be pair objects/small lists with the characters that they play
ex: KS1,[(Sora Amamiya,Aqua),(Rie Takahashi,Megumin)]

SAMPLE DATABASE:

Konosuba1,[Sora Amamiya,Rie Takahashi,Ai Kayano,Jun Fukushima,Yui Horie],
Konosuba2,[Sora Amamiya,Rie Takahashi,Ai Kayano,Jun Fukushima,Yui Horie],
Rezero,[Rie Takahashi,Inori Minase,Rie Murakawa,Yui Horie,Yuusuke Kobayashi],
Kanokari,[Sora Amamiya,Aoi Yuuki,Nao Touyama,Rie Takahashi],
Chihayafuru,[Asami Seto,Mamoru Miyano,Yoshimasa Hosoya],
SteinsGate,[Mamoru Miyano,Kana Hanazawa,Asami Imai],
NoCommon,[RandomVA1,RandomVA2],
